# type-justify

A simple C program that reads in a `.txt` file and prints a justified version to the console. This was written in 2016 for a homework assignment.

## Instructions

Compile and run the program in a terminal. It will ask for the file path of the `.txt` file you wish to justify and the number of characters-per-line the output should contain. I have not looked at the code in a long time and cannot guarantee behavior if invalid user inputs are entered.
